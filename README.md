This project is done as a part of coursework DS5220: Supervised Machine Learning under professor Yanzhi Wang by Ratan Sai Rohith Kokku & Shanmukha Sai Krishna Chaitanya Kota. 

This is a multiclass image classification problem using CIFAR-10 Dataset. 

CIFAR-10 is a dataset which consists of 50000 samples of 32x32 colored training images and 10000 test images. All the images are labeled with 10 types of classes.The 10 different classes are: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each batch with 10000 images. The training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class. 

In this project we have tried to classify the images using conventional machine learning algorithms (like Logistic Regression & Random Forest Classifier) and deep learning algorithms (neural networks & convolution neural networks). Furthermore, we have trained Residual Networks (Resnet 18) using transfer learning technique.
